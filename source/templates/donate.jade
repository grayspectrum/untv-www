  h1 Why Should You Support?
  p.
    I began working on UNTV in November 2013 in an effort to provide my own 
    answer to the new wave of living room devices. With devices like the 
    AppleTV deliberately not shipping with things as apparently novel as USB 
    ports for watching my own digital copies of movies or forcing me to pay 
    insane prices for media which is riddled with DRM, I realized that there 
    was a gap in the free software community. 
  p.
    Granted there is XBMC and its popular fork, Plex, I wanted to build 
    something entirely new. More specifically, I wanted to build a platform 
    using open web technology to open the gates to contributions as wide as 
    possible. With a low barrier to entry and tons of possibilities a free 
    project can thrive.
  p.
    There is more too. UNTV isn't just a hobby or even just software, but a 
    symbol of freedom in an ever-restrictive world when it comes to how you 
    can consume media. I built UNTV because I love 3 things: freedom, movies, 
    and writing code. If you share a love for any of those 3 things, you can 
    support this project by contributing code, sharing it with your friends, 
    or making a small donation.
